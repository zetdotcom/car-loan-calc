## Project info

As project is quite small there was no sense implementing redux.
React Context API also wasn't necesarry as corerct component composition allowed to avoid prop drilling.

Material-ui and Styled Components used to provide UI side od the project. Material-ui chosen mainly because of time constrain, and it also looks nice.
